This repository is a template of a Makefiles I use for most of my C projects.

The 'lib' directory contains the Makefile to create a static and a dynamic
library. It also contains a sample of a test suite. Nothing much, just the
basics.
Usage:
* make -> generate the libraries
* make check -> launch the test suite

The 'program' directory contains the Makefile to create a binary.
Usage:
* make -> generate the binary
* make check -> launch the test suite

The 'simple' directory, is a simpler example using some implicit rules of make.
Usage:
  * make -> generate the binary
  * make check -> launch the test suite

The 'debug' directory is a project using Criterion as a testsuite framework. The
main goal of this directory is to present how to compile normally and also with
two more targets: 'gdb' to generate a binary with the debugging symbols and
'asan' to compile with the address sanitizer.
Usage:
    * make -> Create the 'calculator' program
    * make check -> Generate and launch the Criterion testsuite
    * make gdb -> Compile the program with the -g flag to get symbols in gdb
    * make asan -> Link with the address sanitizer flag.

NB: This repo is mostly designed for my students. I will update it with various
examples along the time.
