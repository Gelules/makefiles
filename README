This repository is a template of a Makefiles I use for most of my C projects.

The 'lib' directory contains the Makefile to create a static and a dynamic
library. It also contains a sample of a test suite. Nothing much, just the
basics.
Usage:
* make -> create the libraries
* make check -> launch the test suite

The 'program' directory contains the Makefile to create a binary.
